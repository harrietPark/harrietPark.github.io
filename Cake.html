       <br><b>Who took my Strawberry Cake?</b> was an individual coursework for the Programming for Game Engines module. This project is a first-person based story-driven game. I tried to add game mechanics layer well into the story plot. The project intends to create an immersive and engaging experience for the player. I thought incorporating narrative into the game will give the player more motivation and results in higher engagement. <br><br> The game starts with the player reading a book called 'Who took my strawberry cake?'. It’s a story about a missing strawberry cake. The main character baked a strawberry cake for her mom’s birthday party in the evening but while she went out to get her parcel, the strawberry cake was missing. Three suspects are the main character’s friends who came to her house that day. At the end of the storybook, it asks “Can you help me find who took my cake?”, and that’s when the game starts.<br><br>Then, the player is placed inside the book they just read. To find out who took the cake, the player has to search for clues by investigating objects inside the room. The magic camera helps the player see the trace of the suspect who took the cake.
